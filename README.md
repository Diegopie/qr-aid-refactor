# QR-aid Codes

## Project Description

This is my personal refactor of a group project. My wonderful, original teammates can be found in [Team](#Team).
Our original repo can be found here ðŸ™‚ [QR-aid Codes](https://github.com/Diegopie/QR-aid-Codes)

This application is designed to solve the issue of organizing play sessions with friends. Rather than deal with a group chat to figure out a play time, users of this app can create a custom QR code to share with their friends. Scanning this code will add the event details to an email calendar so everyone is in sync!  

Users can easily send all this information to their friend's preferred calendar application

## Usage

<img src="./assets/image/demo-example.gif" width="600px"/>

For users who want inspiration for their next play session, they can visit the landing page to find random multiplayer games on every visit.
For users who want to know information about what systems and store platforms a game is on, they can use the search bar in the events page.
With a game selected, users can schedule a time for their play session!
For users who know what event they would like to create, the can press Skip To Custom Calendar in the events page to create a custom calendar QR code for any event!
