# QR-aid Codes

## Project Description

This is my personal refactor of a group project. My wonderful, original teammates can be found in [Team](#Team)

Our original repo can be found here ðŸ™‚ [QR-aid Codes](https://github.com/Diegopie/QR-aid-Codes)

For clan/group leaders to organize their play sessions

Allows them to plan and send invites across different time zones

    Invite includes:
       - Game information
       - Time of play session
       - Store information
       - Other relevant information 

Users can easily send all this information to their friend's preferred calendar application

## User Story

As a clan/group leader who wants to plan a gaming session:

I have a search bar to find my favorite games

When I find my favorite game,

* I see relevant information about it

When I want to make a play session

* I can easily set a data, time, and description of what we're playing and send that to my friends
